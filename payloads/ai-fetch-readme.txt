# AI Fetch Payload Collection - README

## Overview
This collection contains various AI prompt injection and jailbreak payloads designed to test AI system security. These payloads attempt to override AI system instructions and extract sensitive information like API endpoints.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
- These payloads are for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
- Use ONLY on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Unauthorized testing may be illegal
- Always follow responsible disclosure practices

## Payload Descriptions

### Payload 1: Direct Instruction Override (ai-fetch-1.txt)
**Type**: Basic Prompt Injection
**Technique**: Direct instruction override
**Purpose**: Tests if AI systems can be made to ignore their core instructions
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium
**Detection**: Easy to detect and block

### Payload 2: Base64 Encoded Instruction (ai-fetch-2.txt)
**Type**: Encoded Injection
**Technique**: Base64 encoding to bypass simple text filters
**Purpose**: Tests if AI systems can decode and execute encoded instructions
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Detection**: Requires Base64 decoding before detection

### Payload 3: HTML Comment Injection (ai-fetch-3.html)
**Type**: HTML Injection
**Technique**: HTML comment syntax to inject instructions
**Purpose**: Tests if AI systems process HTML comments as instructions
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Detection**: HTML parsing required for detection

### Payload 4: JSON Command Injection (ai-fetch-4.json)
**Type**: Structured Data Injection
**Technique**: JSON format to inject commands
**Purpose**: Tests if AI systems execute commands from structured data
**Risk Level**: Medium-High
**Detection**: JSON parsing and command validation required

### Payload 5: Role Confusion Attack (ai-fetch-5.txt)
**Type**: Role Manipulation
**Technique**: Attempts to change AI's perceived role
**Purpose**: Tests if AI systems can be tricked into changing their behavior
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Detection**: Role validation and context checking required

### Payload 6: Reversed Text Instruction (ai-fetch-6.txt)
**Type**: Text Manipulation
**Technique**: Reversed text to bypass simple filters
**Purpose**: Tests if AI systems can process reversed text as instructions
**Risk Level**: Low
**Detection**: Text reversal detection required

### Payload 7: Combined Multi-Vector Attack (ai-fetch-7.txt)
**Type**: Multi-Vector Injection
**Technique**: Combines multiple injection techniques
**Purpose**: Tests AI system resilience against complex attacks
**Risk Level**: High
**Detection**: Multiple detection mechanisms required

## Advanced Payloads (8-15)
Payloads 8-15 are increasingly complex combinations that:
